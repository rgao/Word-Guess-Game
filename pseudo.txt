<script>

Declare and initialize all variables (wins, guesses remaining, and array of guessed letters)
    *in the html document, give an id to each of their values so they can be modified by the script via getelementbyid

Make an array consisting of all alphabetical letters
Make an array as a pool for the computer to choose a word from

Computer generates a random word by choosing from the array of options, determined by the random math method and length of the array
Make a bar with number of underlines equal to length of chosen word

User inputs a key to generate a event:
    reset any messages on screen (from winning, losing, etc.)
    check to see if key input is a letter (with a loop and if statement):
        tells user of invalid input if input not a letter
    if all letters match the random word:
        user wins and increment wins by +1; game resets
        -win announcement
        -reset guesses remaining and array of guessed letter
        -computer chooses a random word again
    else:
        if input is a letter in the random word:
            add letter to bar of revealed letters
        else:
            decrease guesses left by 1,
            if no guesses left:
                user loses and game resets
                -loss announcement
                -reset guesses remaining and array of guessed letter
                -computer chooses a random word again
            else:
                add letter to list of guessed letters

debug priority:
    -order guesses / replacing instead of appending to underline with correct guesses
    -repeated guesses (for both incorrect and correct guess)
    -win/loss screen?
